<p>
We propose a novel method to solve an underexplored problem, which is to perform image-based age transformation under different conditions specified by text. Our Flux-based approach can effectively preserves the input subject‚Äôs identity while accounting for multiple aging possibilities, without requiring any per-subject training on personalized datasets.

# üñºÔ∏è Code for Image Editing

For image editing, we employ FLUX as the backbone, which comprises several double blocks and single blocks. Double blocks independently modulate text and image features, while single blocks concatenate these features for unified modulation. In this architecture, our method shares features within both the double blocks and the single blocks in order to enhance identity preservation of the edited image.

To perform image editing with your own image, run
```bash
python edit.py \
    --source_prompt 'a photo of male/female at {INPUT AGE} years old' \
    --target_prompt YOUR_TARGET_PROMPT \
    --guidance 2 \
    --source_img_dir /path-to-your-image \
    --num_steps 15 \
    --inject 3 \
    --name 'flux-dev' \
    --offload \
    --output_dir /path-to-output-dir
```

We have provided examples for image editing using FLUX as the backbone, which can be found <a href="./scripts">Here</a>.</strong>
