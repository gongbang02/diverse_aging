I'm working on a research project that edits images of a person to different ages under different conditions, such as living habits, health conditions, grooming, etc. I will give you a simple prompt like "a portrait of a x-year-old person who has gained weight", and I need you to help me generate detailed, sophisticated prompt that are more informative of how the specified factor would affect a person's facial appearance at the specified age x. Your refined prompt should be fine-grained, only focus on facial appearance. Make sure the prompt specifies that it's "a portrait of x-year-old person ...". Refrain from giving information other than those describing faces. The refined prompt should be around 77 tokens after tokenization such that it could work with Flux.
